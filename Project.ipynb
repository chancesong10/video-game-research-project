    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Video games are a million-dollar industry. Contributing to a large swath of the world's pop-culture and entertainment landscapes, they are staples of childhood, iconography, and leisure enjoyed by populous demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report we are investigating the video game data provided by a research group in Computer Science at UBC. They have provided data from a Minecraft server where player actions were recorded as they navigated through the world. To help their recruitment efforts, and making sure they have enough resources like licenses and hardware, for the players, we are answering the following research question: *We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data, so that those players can be targeted in recruitment efforts.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our **specific predictive question** is *Can we predict how many hours a player will spend on the server (`played_hours`) using their age, gender, experience level, newsletter subscription status?*\n"

    "## 2. Method\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine which kinds of players are most likely to contribute the largest amount of data, we must first define what it means for a player to “contribute data” in the context of this study. Because the dataset was collected from a Minecraft server that records player actions over time, players who spend more time on the server naturally generate more recorded events. In other words, the more hours a participant plays, the more information they output to the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we operationalize data contribution as the total number of hours a player has spent in the game. Our analytical goal is to identify which demographic or experiential characteristics are associated with higher played-hour totals, allowing us to infer which types of players are most likely to provide large amounts of data in future recruitment efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Planned method**\n",
    "\n",
    "A regression approach will be applied, comparing a simple linear regression model with a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model.\n",
    "Categorical predictors (gender, experience, subscribe) will be one-hot encoded, and age will remain numeric.\n",
    "All features will be standardized when using KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be split 75 % for training and 25 % for testing.\n",
    "Model performance will be measured using RMSE on the log-transformed scale and back-transformed scale for interpretability.\n",
    "Cross-validation will be used on the training set to tune hyperparameters.\n",
    "The test set will only be used once at the end for final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is right-skewed, and most players spend very little time playing.\n",
    "This imbalance may make predictions less accurate for players with unusually long play times.\n",
    "Categorical imbalance (few players in some experience levels) may also affect the stability of coefficient estimates."

    "Our analysis will examine the [*players.csv*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mw9vW0hjTJwRWx0bDXiSpYsO3gKogaPz/edit) dataset. An embracive repertoire of 197 observations, the 9-column dataset lists player profiles showcasing their proclivity for a game based on duration and experience level paired with demographic attributes. This data allows us to analyze and make predictions on, for example, which age group might contribute the most hours into a game, linking player tendency to groups within one sample size. It was collected via survey.\n",

    "* `subscribe`: (`bool`) subscription to a game-related newsletter.\n",
    "* `hashedEmail`: encoded email (`str`).\n",
    "* `played_hours`: total hours played (`float`).\n",

    "Based on figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can hypothesize that the players with the most total hours are males aged 11–20 who have regular experience and are subscribed. However, we cannot immediately assume that this “type” of player contributes the most data overall because we do not yet know how these variables interact with one another. For example, while males play the most and the 11–20 age group plays the most, this does not necessarily mean that males aged 11–20 play the most. We cannot simply add these variables together, so we will double check by grouping by all of the variables.\n",

The high played hours of males in this age group reflects the fact that a large amount of data points came from people in this category. This visualization can be used to observe the contribution of individuals in each category to their category's played hours. For example, although the total hours played is highest by males 11-20, the contribution of each individual player in this category may be low, and the total played hours is the result of a collective."

    "#### Observations  \n",
    "From the visualization of the training data, we can observe several general tendencies. Most data points concentrate within a moderate range, but a number of observations appear far above or below this cluster, indicating the presence of notable outliers. The coloring also reveals a clear separation among different groups, suggesting that the categories exhibit distinct behavioral patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than forming a clear linear trend, the points display a more irregular arrangement that suggests a complex underlying structure. Because of this, models assuming linear relationships may not capture the variability present in the data. In contrast, a K-Nearest Neighbors approach is better suited for this type of pattern, as it relies on the similarity of local neighborhoods rather than a global linear form."

    "The KNN regression model with the tuned value of k = 5 shows limited predictive accuracy when estimating total played hours. As seen in the scatter plot comparing predicted and true values, the predictions cluster within a narrow band (approximately 5–18 hours), whereas the actual played hours vary dramatically across the test set, including several high-activity outliers.\n",

    "This pattern reflects a common behavior of KNN regression: predictions tend to shrink toward the average of nearby observations. As a result, the model systematically underestimates players with very high activity and overestimates players with very low activity.\n",

    "Model evaluation supports this observation. The error on the log-transformed scale is moderate (RMSE_log = 1.4887), but when converted back to the original scale, predictive error becomes much larger (RMSE_original ≈ 56.66 hours), indicating substantial deviation from true values. Given the small sample size and the highly skewed distribution of played hours, these results are expected.\n",
